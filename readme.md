### Donations
I am supporting this addon in my free time mostly and it was quite a ride since I already first
created it. But since my lack of time for playing gmod has been drastically increased some
people asked me if I accept donations, here is [the link to my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/DeyanVasilev).

### Description
This repository contains [controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) and fast
traces [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) library for
[wire expression 2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire/wiki/Expression-2). It gives the user ability
to preform [fast traces](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/util/TraceLine) to gather data from the
game environment and [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) the
[process variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_variable) linked to this environment,
which are basically internal
[process control states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation). Some times they
can be directly measured and controlled, sometimes they need to be
[estimated or observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_observer). But in general the
[negative feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) you need to do yourself.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your addon folder of Garry's mod or subscribe it in the
[WORKSHOP](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1440897301). Beware though,
the workshop version will be some revisions behind the repo.

### Tutorials
Yes, I do a dedicated gameplay information can be obtained in the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/ControlSystemsE2/wiki).
