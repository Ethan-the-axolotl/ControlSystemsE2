### Donations
I am supporting this addon in my free time mostly and it was quite a ride since I already first
created it. But since my lack of time for playing gmod has been drastically increased some
people asked me if I accept donations, here is [the link to my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/DeyanVasilev).

### Description
This repository contains [controller][ref-PID] and fast traces [OOP][ref-OOP] library for
[wire expression 2][ref-E2]. It gives the user ability to preform [fast traces][ref-trace] to
gather data from the game environment and [control][ref-control] the [process variables][ref-proc-var]
linked to this environment, which are basically internal [process control states][ref-proc-sta]. Some
times they can be directly measured and controlled, sometimes they need to be [estimated or observed][ref-observe].
But in general the [negative feedback loop][ref-feedback] you need to do yourself.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your addons folder of Garry's mod or subscribe it in the
[WORKSHOP][ref-WS]. Beware though, the workshop version will be some revisions behind the repo. You
can also obtain this addon from the [official wire-extras][ref-wir-ext] repo, where it is included as
a feature. The addon is an officially included since [this PR][ref_wire-pr].

### Tutorials
Yes, I do a dedicated gameplay information can be obtained in the
[Wiki page][ref-wiki].
